# myRogue
Roguelike game made in Java for fun. The game allows the player to move up and down levels of a randomly generated map. The player takes and delivers damage to and takes damage from 'bats' flying around each layer of the cave and can die. The game continues until the player finds the hidden staff. 
Players have a range of vision so they can only see ~9 tiles in each direction around them.
